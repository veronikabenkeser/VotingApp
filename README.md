<h1>PollIt!</h1>
This project was built as a part of Free Code Camp's Full-Stack Development curriculum.

<h2>User Stories</h2>
1. As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
2. As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
3. As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
4. As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
5. As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
6. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
7. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form.
8. As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
9. If a registered user has already voted in a poll, he/she will not be able to vote in that poll again and will instead see the results of the poll.
